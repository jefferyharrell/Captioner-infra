# Project Status â€“ Captioner Infrastructure & Backend

**Last updated:** 2025-04-19 15:34 PDT

## Project State

- STATUS.md is now tracked in the infra repo (`Captioner-infra/STATUS.md`).
- All code and infra changes are committed; working tree is clean.
- Python backend uses a venv at `Captioner-backend/.venv` with all dependencies (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, pytest, etc.).
- FastAPI backend MVP is in progress; initial endpoints (e.g., `/photos`) and infrastructure are implemented, with more API endpoints to come.
- 100% type annotations, Black formatting, and Ruff linting enforced.
- DropboxStorage backend is default, pluggable via env var; all error paths are tested.
- Backend test coverage is 99%+ (well above 90% minimum), all lint/type/tests passing and enforced in CI.
- Pre-commit hooks (Ruff, Pyright, YAML, whitespace, coverage, etc.) are enforced locally and in CI.
- Docker Compose (`Captioner-infra/docker-compose.yml`) injects secrets via environment variables; `.env` is ignored by git and optional for local dev only.
- Project structure, SPEC.md (v1.0.4), and STATUS.md are fully in sync. `/photos` endpoint now returns a list of database row IDs (primary keys), not storage keys or filenames. Photo model uses `object_key` as the canonical storage identifier, matching backend, API, and storage abstraction.
- Configuration is via environment variables only; no secrets in code or version control.
- Project rules require Conventional Commits and prohibit newlines in git commit messages.
- Test-driven development (TDD) is strictly followed.

## What Works

- All code, infra, and configuration are committed and up-to-date.
- `/photos` API endpoint is implemented, returns DB row IDs, and is fully TDD-tested (normal, empty, pagination, error cases), with >95% coverage.
- Linting (Ruff), type checking (Pyright), and coverage enforcement are active in pre-commit and CI.
- Docker Compose supports both local dev and production best practices (env var injection, no secrets in code).
- Project structure, SPEC.md, and documentation are consistent and current.
- Storage abstraction (dropbox, filesystem, s3) is implemented and pluggable.

## Next Steps

- Implement `GET /photos/{id}` endpoint for photo metadata.
- Begin frontend integration (once backend endpoints are finalized).
- Expand documentation as new features are added.

## Known Gaps

- Search and ML auto-captioning are out of MVP scope.
- No gallery/grid or upload/delete UI in backend.
- User accounts and authentication not yet implemented.
